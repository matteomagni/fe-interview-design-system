# Frontend Interview - Design System

Hi,
This is my implementation of the Tabs component, using:

- `react`
- `styled-components`
- `typescript`
- `storybook`

## Install and run

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run Storybook To test the Tabs component
pnpm storybook

# Alternatively, you can test a production build of the component
pnpm preview
# A static page with the Tabs Component will be served at http://localhost:4173/
```
